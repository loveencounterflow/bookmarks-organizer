  title:  Parsing Expressions by Recursive Descent
  tags:   programming/language parsing
  about:  by Theodore Norvell. This article is about parsing expressions such as `a*b - a*d - e*f` using a
          technique known as recursive descent. I will present the classic solution, a well known
          alternative known as the "Shunting Yard Algorithm", and a less well known one that I have called
          "Precedence Climbing".

  title:  Owl: A parser generator for visibly pushdown languages.
  about:  Owl is a parser generator which targets the class of visibly pushdown languages. It is:

          * Efficient — Owl can parse any syntactically valid grammar in linear time.
          * Understandable — like regular expressions, its parsing model (and error messages[1]) can be
            understood without talking about parser states, backtracking, lookahead, or any other
            implementation details.
          * Easy to use — using Owl's interpreter mode, you can design, test, and debug your grammar without
            writing any code. An Owl grammar compiles to a single C header file which provides a
            straightforward parse tree API.

          Owl uses [a *stacked* finite state automaton](https://github.com/ianh/owl#automata) to recognize
          nested bracketed constructs.

  quote:
          * Persistent:              No messages are lost in case of a consumer failure.
          * Atomic:                  A message is delivered only once to one consumer (in FIFO order) so you would never fall into a situation where a message could be processed more than once.
          * Fast:                    13K+ messages/second on a virtual machine of 4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM and running one consumer.
          * Concurrent consumers:    A queue can be consumed by many consumers, launched on the same or on different hosts.
          * Message TTL:             A message will expire and not be consumed if it has been in the queue for longer than the TTL.
          * Message consume timeout: The amount of time for a consumer to consume a message. If the timeout exceeds, message processing is cancelled and the message is re-queued to be consumed again.
          * Highly optimized:        No promises, no async/await, small memory footprint, no memory leaks.
          * Monitorable:             Statistics (input/processing/acks/unacks messages rates, online consumers, queues, etc.) are provided in real-time.
          * Logging:                 Supports JSON log format for troubleshooting and analytics purposes.
          * Configurable:            Many options and features can be configured.

          (from
          https://www.reddit.com/r/CoderRadio/comments/7t9al0/blackbox_safely_store_secrets_in/)
          i follow the 12factor step of storing that data in environment
          variables and loading the environment variables from decrypted files
          stored in git. blackbox sets up a lot of the gitignore and other hooks
          to make sure unencrypted data doesn't get stashed into git, but
          instead is deleted upon commit. it depends on open pgp, which is a bit
          of a commitment to learning and managing, but for me it was well worth
          it.

  title:  A simple and composable way to validate data in JavaScript.
  tags:   nodejs data-types programming/type-validation

  about:  Superstruct makes it easy to define interfaces and then validate
          JavaScript data against them. Its type annotation API was inspired by
          Typescript, Flow, Go, and GraphQL, giving it a familiar and easy to
          understand API.

          But Superstruct is designed for validating data at runtime, so it
          throws (or returns) detailed runtime errors for you or your end users.
          This is especially useful in situations like accepting arbitrary input
          in a REST or GraphQL API. But it can even be used to validate internal
          data structures at runtime when needed.

          * N-API support means we ship prebuilds and in general works on new Node.js releases.
          * Multithreading support means multiple calls to FUSE can run in parallel.
          * Close to feature complete in terms of the the FUSE API.
          * Embedded shared library support means users do not have to install FUSE from a 3rd party.
          * API support for initial FUSE kernel extension configuration so you can control the user
            experience.

  title:  Pass-Join: A Partition based Method for Similarity Joins
  tags:   text distance similarity levenshtein similarity-join
  by:     Guoliang Li, Dong Deng, Jiannan Wang, Jianhua Feng
  about:  As an essential operation in data cleaning, the similarity join has attracted considerable
          attention from the database community. In this paper, we study string similarity joins with
          edit-distance constraints, which find similar string pairs from two large sets of strings whose
          edit distance is within a given threshold. Existing algorithms are efficient either for short
          strings or for long strings, and there is no algorithm that can efficiently and adaptively support
          both short strings and long strings. To address this problem, we propose a partition-based method
          called Pass-Join. Pass-Join partitions a string into a set of segments and creates inverted
          indices for the segments. Then for each string, Pass-Join selects some of its substrings and uses
          the selected substrings to find candidate pairs using the inverted indices. We devise efficient
          techniques to select the substrings and prove that our method can minimize the number of selected
          substrings. We develop novel pruning techniques to efficiently verify the candidate pairs.
          Experimental results show that our algorithms are efficient for both short strings and long
          strings, and outperform state-of-the-art methods on real datasets.

          * Complaining about inadequacy of BNF for represeting infix expressions.
          * Providing a description and implementation of Pratt parsing algorithm which sticks to the core
            and doesn’t introduce a DSL-y abstraction.
          * Understanding the algorithm myself for hopefully the last time. I’ve implemented a
            production-grade Pratt parser once, but I no longer immediately understand that code :-)

  about:  Do not use this. It's full of bad ideas. One of them is that it needs to have an environment
          variable defined before it can run (instead of using the CWD). The next bad idea is that it only
          runs on Ubuntu, so not on Mint (wha?). After commenting out that senseless check, the configure
          script proceeded with `sudo apt-get install -y zip unzip make git wget vim ocaml default-jdk maven
          nodejs php-cli ruby cargo golang-go` which is... NOT a good idea. Yes, that's right: in order to
          check for sane RegExes this software thinks it needs all of Java, NodeJS, OCaml, Vim (???), PHP,
          Ruby, and Go. And Zip and Git on top of it. DO NOT USE.

  about:  DataSpread is a spreadsheet-database hybrid system, with a spreadsheet frontend, and a database
          backend. Thus, DataSpread inherits the flexibility and ease-of-use of spreadsheets, as well as the
          scalability and power of databases. A paper describing DataSpread's architecture, design
          decisions, and optimization can be found
          [here](http://data-people.cs.illinois.edu/dataspread.pdf). DataSpread is a multi-year project,
          supported by the National Science Foundation via award number 1633755.

          DataSpread is built using PostgreSQL and ZKSpreadsheet, an open-source web-based spreadsheet tool.

          DataSpread's version 0.1 enables users to scale to billions of cells and return results for common
          spreadsheet operations within seconds. It does so via on-demand loading of spreadsheet data.

          to React, add a table of contents, or compile to man pages.

          It aims to do for Markdown what Esprima did for JavaScript and PostCSS for CSS: bring Markdown

  about:  Pure Python implementation of the squarify treemap layout algorithm. The function returns a list
          of JSON objects, each one a rectangle with coordinates corresponding to the given coordinate
          system and area proportional to the corresponding value. The rectangles can be easily plotted
          using, for example, d3.js.

          This page describes a program, `ent`, which applies various tests to sequences of bytes stored in
          files and reports the results of those tests. The program is useful for evaluating pseudorandom
          number generators for encryption and statistical sampling applications, compression algorithms,
          and other applications where the information density of a file is of interest.

          This high performance tool outputs on demand of its input:

            * The Shannon entropy estimation (through stdout).
            * The minimum, medium and maximum frequencies (through stderr).
            * The frequency of possibilities (through entropy.freq file).
            * The frequency of frequencies (through entropy.gaus file).

          These outputs are useful to measure the equiprobability regardless of the unpredictability.

          * ❤️ Powerful: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in JSX-based projects.

          * 💻 Everything is a component: Import JSX components and render them directly in your MDX
            document.

          * 🔧 Customizable: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown element.

          * 📚 Markdown-based: The simplicity and elegance of Markdown remains, you interleave JSX only when
            you want to.

          * 🔥 Blazingly blazing fast: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs during the build stage.

          Before MDX, some of the benefits of writing Markdown were lost when integrating with JSX.
          Implementations were often template string-based which required lots of escaping and cumbersome
          syntax.

          MDX seeks to make writing with Markdown and JSX simpler while being more expressive. Writing is
          fun again when you combine components, that can even be dynamic or load data, with the simplicity
          of Markdown for long-form content.

          enhances the repertoire of Python programmers to include the tools of
          modern functional programming, in such a way that those tools are easy
          to use and immensely powerful; that is, Coconut does to functional
          programming what Python did to imperative programming.

          similarity between two images. The SSIM index can be viewed as a
          quality measure of one of the images being compared, provided the
          other image is regarded as of perfect quality. It is an improved
          version of the universal image quality index proposed before. Detailed

  about:  ripgrep is definitely becoming a popular alternative (if not the most popular) to grep command.
          Editors like Visual Studio Code and Atom are using ripgrep to power their search offerings. The
          major selling point is its default behavior for recursive search and speed. The project doesn't
          aim to be compatible with POSIX and behavior varies with respect to GNU grep in terms of features,
          option names, output style, regular expressions, etc.

          Playwright is focused on enabling cross-browser web automation platform that is ever-green,
          capable, reliable and fast. Our primary goal with Playwright is to improve automated UI testing by
          eliminating flakiness, improving the speed of execution and offering insights into the browser
          operation.

          Q: How does Playwright relate to Puppeteer?

          We are the same team that built Puppeteer. Puppeteer proved that there is a lot of interest in the
          new generation of ever-green, capable and reliable automation drivers. With Playwright, we'd like
          to take it one step further and offer the same functionality for all the popular rendering
          engines. We'd like to see Playwright vendor-neutral and shared governed.

  about:  PostCSS is a tool for transforming styles with JS plugins. These plugins can lint your CSS,
          support variables and mixins, transpile future CSS syntax, inline images, and more.

          PostCSS takes a CSS file and provides an API to analyze and modify its rules (by transforming them
          into an Abstract Syntax Tree). This API can then be used by plugins to do a lot of useful things,
          e.g. to find errors automatically insert vendor prefixes.

          Currently, PostCSS has more than 200 plugins.

  remark: consider reservations raised @ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22155370
  about:  GNU recutils is a set of tools and libraries to access human-editable, text-based databases called
          recfiles. The data is stored as a sequence of records, each record containing an arbitrary number
          of named fields. Advanced capabilities usually found in other data storage systems are supported:
          data types, data integrity (keys, mandatory fields, etc.) as well as the ability of records to
          refer to other records (sort of foreign keys). Despite its simplicity, recfiles can be used to
          store medium-sized databases.

          So, yet another data storage system? The mere existence of this package deserves an explanation.
          There is a rich set of already available free data storage systems, covering a broad range of
          requirements. Big systems having complex data storage requirements will probably make use of some
          full-fledged relational system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Less demanding applications, or
          applications with special deployment requirements, may find it more convenient to use a simpler
          system such as SQLite, where the data is stored in a single binary file. XML files are often used
          to store configuration settings for programs, and to encode data for transmission through
          networks.

  title:  Universal Method to Sort Complex Information Found
  about:  The nearest neighbor problem asks where a new point fits into an existing data set. A few
          researchers set out to prove that there was no universal way to solve it. Instead, they found such
          a way.

          For higher-dimensional data, where each point can be defined by hundreds or thousands of values,
          Voronoi diagrams become too computationally intensive. So instead, computer scientists draw
          partitions using a technique called “locality sensitive hashing (LSH)” that was first defined by
          Indyk and Rajeev Motwani in 1998. LSH algorithms draw partitions randomly. This makes them faster
          to run but also less accurate — instead of finding a point’s exact nearest neighbor, they
          guarantee you’ll find a point that’s within some fixed distance of the actual nearest neighbor.

* url:    https://github.com/kentcdodds/match-sorter
  about:  This follows a simple and sensible (user friendly) algorithm that makes it easy for you to filter
          and sort a list of items based on given input. Items are ranked based on sensible criteria that
          result in a better user experience.

          To explain the ranking system, I'll use countries as an example:

          * CASE SENSITIVE EQUALS: Case-sensitive equality trumps all. These will be first. (ex. France
            would match France, but not france)
          * EQUALS: Case-insensitive equality (ex. France would match france)
          * STARTS WITH: If the item starts with the given value (ex. Sou would match South Korea or South
            Africa)
          * WORD STARTS WITH: If the item has multiple words, then if one of those words starts with the
            given value (ex. Repub would match Dominican Republic)
          * CASE STARTS WITH: If the item has a defined case (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case or
            kebab-case), then if one of the parts starts with the given value (ex. kingdom would match
            unitedKingdom or united_kingdom)
          * CASE ACRONYM If the item's case matches the synonym (ex. uk would match united-kingdom or
            UnitedKingdom)
          * CONTAINS: If the item contains the given value (ex. ham would match Bahamas)
          * ACRONYM: If the item's acronym is the given value (ex. us would match United States)
          * SIMPLE MATCH: If the item has letters in the same order as the letters of the given value (ex.
            iw would match Zimbabwe, but not Kuwait because it must be in the same order). Furthermore, if
            the item is a closer match, it will rank higher (ex. ua matches Uruguay more closely than United
            States of America, therefore Uruguay will be ordered before United States of America)

          This ranking seems to make sense in people's minds.

  about:  Fast multi-threaded content-dependent chunking deduplication for Buffers in C++ with a reference
          implementation in Javascript. Ships with extensive tests, a fuzz test and a benchmark.

          Compared to fixed size chunking, which fails to detect most of the same chunk cut-points when file
          content is shifted slightly, variable size content-dependent chunking can find most chunk
          cut-points no matter how the chunks move around. You can tune the absolute minimum and maximum
          chunk sizes required, as well as the expected average chunk size required.

          While content-dependent chunking is more CPU-intensive than fixed size chunking, the chunking
          algorithm of @ronomon/deduplication can detect chunks at a rate of more than 1.5 GB per second per
          CPU core. This is significantly faster than the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which is 2.5× slower by
          way of contrast. @ronomon/deduplication achieves chunking speeds comparable to FastCDC.

* urls:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin–Karp_algorithm
  tags:   content-dependent-chunking rolling-hash deduplication string-searching

          The Rabin–Karp algorithm or Karp–Rabin algorithm is a string-searching algorithm created by
          Richard M. Karp and Michael O. Rabin (1987) that uses hashing to find an exact match of a pattern
          string in a text. It uses a rolling hash to quickly filter out positions of the text that cannot
          match the pattern, and then checks for a match at the remaining positions. Generalizations of the
          same idea can be used to find more than one match of a single pattern, or to find matches for more
          than one pattern.

          A practical application of the algorithm is detecting plagiarism. Given source material, the
          algorithm can rapidly search through a paper for instances of sentences from the source material,
          ignoring details such as case and punctuation. Because of the abundance of the sought strings,
          single-string searching algorithms are impractical.

  about:  Rsync-based OSX-like time machine for Linux, MacOS and BSD for atomic and resumable local and
          remote backups

          timemachine is a tiny and stable KISS driven and POSIX compliant script that mimics the behavior
          of OSX's timemachine. It uses rsync to incrementally back up your data to a different directory,
          hard disk or remote server via SSH. All operations are incremental, atomic and automatically
          resumable.

          Backups are always done incrementally using rsync's ability to hardlink to previous backup
          directories (using `rsync --link-dest=$DIR`, hardlink to files in `$DIR` when unchanged). You can
          nevertheless always see the full backup on the file system of any incrementally made backup
          without having to generate it. This will also be true when deleting any of the previously created
          backup directories.

          Executable is 1 bash script.
  pro:    fast
  pro:    looks mature
  con:    no GUI
  note:   so far no tools to check for repo link status (what are duplicate, what are new files)
  verdict:  may be used to simplify backups using `rsync` with `--link-dest`, so yes

* urls:   http://rsnapshot.org/rsnapshot/docs/docbook/rest.html

          https://github.com/rsnapshot/rsnapshot
  see:    https://github.com/cytopia/linux-timemachine

          rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility. It can take incremental snapshots of local and remote
          filesystems for any number of machines.

          Local filesystem snapshots are handled with rsync(1). Secure remote connections are handled with
          rsync over ssh(1), while anonymous rsync connections simply use an rsync server. Both remote and
          local transfers depend on rsync.

          rsnapshot saves much more disk space than you might imagine. The amount of space required is
          roughly the size of one full backup, plus a copy of each additional file that is changed.
          rsnapshot makes extensive use of hard links, so if the file doesn't change, the next snapshot is
          simply a hard link to the exact same file.

          rsnapshot will typically be invoked as root by a cron job, or series of cron jobs. It is possible,
          however, to run as any arbitrary user with an alternate configuration file.

          All important options are specified in a configuration file, which is located by default at
          /etc/rsnapshot.conf. An alternate file can be specified on the command line. There are also
          additional options which can be passed on the command line.
  pro:    works
  pro:    looks mature
  pro:    uses rsync, hard links, so human-readable
  pro:    documentation
  pro:    many, many options
  pro:    can configure how many copies to keep per level
  pro:    can configure target location per source location
  con:    configuration is not easy
  con:    in a test, reported thousands of new files (as expected), but I was unable to find where they
          were actually stored, so not good
  verdict:  rather use linux-timemachine at this point

  about:    This repo is a revamp of an old proof of concept that I wrote in 2013 to answer the question

            entire Linux kernel, or as much text as will fit in your GPU's ram".

            Wideboard uses WebGL 1, some special shaders, and some simple GPU-compatible data structures to
            render arbitrarily large amounts of monospace, unformatted text in a web browser. It has been
            tested with 56000 files from the Linux repo (31 million lines of source, or around 1.2 gigabytes
            of raw text) and runs at 60 fps while using single-digit percentages of a 3080ti GPU. It should
            run equally well on integrated GPUs, barring memory limits.

            event loop based on requestAnimationFrame and supports throttling of pointermove and wheel
            events via its custom tick event for efficient animation [2]. Cartesian coordinates for
            scientific and engineering applications are supported. Pan, drag and zoom operations based on an
            user defined origin can be done.

            It was primarily implemented for use in engineering education and conference presentations.

            canvasInteractor is the modern and more minimal successor of deprecated canvas-area [3].

            been translated, scaled and skewed, and they will morph correctly.

            There is some interesting stuff happening in the background to make the morphings work. To learn
            about them, read the [Animate between complex

            that your viewport element can be your document body, some browsers appear to do even more
            optimization for that special case.

            stacked vertically and pages arranged horizontally by adding the class ft-cross to the Flowtime
            element in the HTML document. See How to Build the Markup section for an example.

            Multiple Controls Navigation. You can navigate through pages via links, keyboard, mouse,
            gestures or deep-linking. Links are managed using the href value targeting a formatted hash
            destination; see the demo's source code for more examples. Keyboard navigation is based on arrow
            keys with the Shift key as a modifier to jump over fragments or sections.

  title:    LCH colors in CSS: what, why, and how?

  about:    LCH is a color space that has several advantages over the RGB/HSL colors we’re familiar with in
            CSS. In fact, I’d go as far as to call it a game-changer, and here’s why.

            1. We actually get access to about 50% more colors.
            2. LCH (and Lab) is perceptually uniform
            3. LCH lightness actually means something

            LCH stands for “Lightness Chroma Hue”. The parameters loosely correspond to HSL’s, however there
            are a few crucial differences:

            The hue angles don’t fully correspond to HSL’s hues. E.g. 0 is not red, but more of a magenta
            and 180 is not turquoise but more of a bluish green, and is exactly complementary.

            In HSL, saturation is a neat 0-100 percentage, since it’s a simple transformation of RGB into
            polar coordinates. In LCH however, Chroma is theoretically unbounded. LCH (like Lab) is designed
            to be able to represent the entire spectrum of human vision, and not all of these colors can be
            displayed by a screen, even a P3 screen. Not only is the maximum chroma different depending on
            screen gamut, it’s actually different per color.

  title:    Zapatos: Zero-Abstraction Postgres for TypeScript
  about:    Postgres and TypeScript are each, individually, fabulous.

            Zapatos aims to make them work beautifully together. No abstractions, no distractions: just your
            database, with type safety.

            To achieve this aim, Zapatos does these five things:

            * **Typescript schema**—A command-line tool speaks to your Postgres database and writes up a
              detailed TypeScript schema for every table. This is just a means to an end: it enables the
              next three things in this list.

            * **Arbitrary SQL**—Simple building blocks help you write arbitrary SQL using tagged templates,
              and manually apply the right types to what goes in and what comes back.

            * **Everyday CRUD**—Shortcut functions produce everyday CRUD queries with no fuss and no
              surprises, fully and automatically typed.

            * **JOINs as nested JSON**—Nested shortcut calls generate LATERAL JOIN queries, resulting in
              arbitrarily complex nested JSON structures, still fully and automatically typed.

            * **Transactions**—A transaction function helps with managing and retrying transactions. Show me

  title:    The lazy programmer's guide to writing thousands of tests - Scott Wlaschin
  tags:     test-driven-development property-based-testing programming
  about:    We are all familiar with example-based testing, as typified by TDD and BDD, where each test is
            hand-crafted.

            But there's another approach to writing tests. In the "property-based testing" approach, a
            single test is run hundreds of times with randomly generated inputs. Property-based testing is a
            great way to find edge cases, and also helps you to understand and document the behavior of your
            code under all conditions.

            This talk will introduce property-based testing, show you how it works, and demonstrate why you
            should consider adding this powerful technique to your toolbelt.

              of different directions.)

            * Use HarfBuzz to choose and lay out suitable glyphs for the specified text, controlled by
              appropriate features selected from the specified font.

  about:    XL is an extensible programming language, designed to accomodate a variety of programming needs

            Being extensible means that the language is designed to make it very easy for programmers to
            adapt the language to suit their needs, for example by adding new programming constructs. In XL,
            extending the language is a routine operation, much like adding a function or creating a class
            in more traditional programming languages. This extensibility is demonstrated by the fact that
            operations that are built-in in other programming languages, such as integer arithmetic, basic
            types or loops, are part of the standard library in XL.

            Wiktionary, graphically similar characters are listed at the top of entry pages, and are
            collected here for reference.

            This page discusses characters or components which may be confused with each other, yielding the
            wrong character or an invalid character, not characters which are complicated but unlikely to be
            confused with other characters.

            This page does not treat variant forms or simplifications, subtle or otherwise, such as 殼 to 殻,
            as these are very numerous and are more correctly incorrect forms or simply errors, rather than
            confusions. Variant forms are listed at individual characters. An exception is made when such a
            variation illustrates a more general distinction, such as 鄉 versus 郷, which illustrates 良 vs. 艮.

  about:    Treating everything as a string is the way through which the great power and versatility of UNIX
            tools is achieved. However, sometimes the constant parsing of strings gets a bit cumbersome.

            UXY is a tool to manipulate UXY format, which is basically a two-dimensional table that's both
            human- and machine-readable.

            The format is deliberately designed to be as similar to the output of standard tools, such as ls
            or ps, as possible.

            UXY tool also wraps some common UNIX tools and exports their output in UXY format. Along with
            converters from/to other common data formats (e.g. JSON) it is meant to allow for quick and
            painless access to the data.

            FontVal.exe is the GUI, and FontValidator.exe shows usage and example if run without arguments;
            both should be self-explanatory. We provide all-in-one native command-line binaries,
            FontValidator, for Mac OS X and Linux, as of Release 2.1.1. Georg Seifert contributed a friendly

            Cfftot1 translates a Compact Font Format (CFF) font, or a PostScript-flavored OpenType font,
            into PostScript Type 1 format. It correctly handles subroutines and hints.

            Mmafm and mmpfb create instances of multiple-master fonts: mmafm creates the AFM file (font
            metrics) for an instance, given the AMFM and AFM files distributed with the multiple master;
            mmpfb creates a normal, single-master font for an instance, given the multiple master font
            itself. These tools help multiple master fonts work with UNIX programs for single-master fonts,
            like afm2tfm, ps2pk, GhostScript ps2pdf, and the X11 Type 1 font server. Mmafm and mmpfb were
            previously distributed in their own package, mminstance.

            Otfinfo reports information about OpenType fonts, such as the features they support and the

  about:    ReScript The JavaScript-like language you've been waiting for. Previously BuckleScript & Reason.

            JavaScript's been aggressively optimized by talented engineers over a long span. Unfortunately,
            even for seasoned JS devs, it can be hard to know how to properly leverage JS's performance.
            **ReScript's type system and compiler naturally guides you toward writing code that's very often
            performant by default, with good leverage of various Just-In-Time optimizations (hidden classes,
            inline caching, avoiding deopts, etc).**

            A widespread adage to write fast JavaScript code is to write as if there's a type system (in
            order to trigger JS engines' good optimization heuristics); ReScript gives you a real one and
            generates code that's friendly to optimizations by default.

  tags:     keyboard linux keyboard/IME linux/evdev linux/udev linux/input-devices
  about:    intercept's purpose is to capture input from a given device (optionally grabbing it) and write
            such raw input to stdout. uinput does the reverse, it receives raw input from stdin and write it
            to a virtual uinput device created by cloning characteristics of real devices, from YAML
            configuration, or both.

            So, assuming $DEVNODE as the path of the device, something like `/dev/input/by-id/some-kbd-id`,
            the following results in a no-op:

            `intercept -g $DEVNODE | uinput -d $DEVNODE`

            In this case using `-g` is important so that the target device is grabbed for exclusive access,
            allowing the new virtual device created by uinput to substitute it completely: we grab it and
            others can grab the clone. Now additional processing can be added in the middle easily.

  about:    postgresqlfs is a FUSE driver to access PostgreSQL databases as a file system. It exposes the
            object structure of a PostgreSQL database instance as directories and files that you can operate
            on using file system tools.

            The idea is that you can use this together with Midnight Commander to browse and edit a database
            in text mode in situations where psql would be to cumbersome but pgAdmin or phpPgAdmin are not
            available.

            That will give you possibility to use normal file-system tools (cat, grep, vi) to manipulate
            data in database.

            It's actually opposite of Oracle's intention to put everything into database.

  title:    sqlfs.pl - Mount Fuse filesystem on a SQL database
  about:    This script will create a userspace filesystem stored entirely in a SQL database. Only the
            MySQL, SQLite and PostgreSQL database engines are currently supported. Most functionality is
            supported, including hard and symbolic links, seek() and tell(), binary data, sparse files, and
            the ability to unlink a file while there is still a filehandle open on it.

            This is a front end to the DBI::Filesystem module, which creates a fully-functioning userspace
            filesystem on top of a relational database. Unlike other filesystem-to-DBM mappings, such as
            Fuse::DBI, this one creates and manages a specific schema designed to support filesystem
            operations. If you wish to mount a filesystem on an arbitrary DBM schema, you want Fuse::DBI,
            not this.

            Most filesystem functionality is implemented, including hard and soft links, sparse files,
            ownership and access modes, UNIX permission checking and random access to binary files. Very
            large files (up to multiple gigabytes) are supported without performance degradation.

            Why would you use this? The main reason is that it allows you to use DBMs functionality such as
            accessibility over the network, database replication, failover, etc. In addition, the underlying
            DBI::Filesystem module can be extended via subclassing to allow additional functionality such as
            arbitrary access control rules, searchable file and directory metadata, full-text indexing of
            file contents, etc.

  title:    city roads
  about:    Visualization of all roads within any city

            The data is fetched from OpenStreetMap using [overpass API](http://overpass-turbo.eu/). While
            that API is free (as long as you follow ODbL licenses), it can be rate-limited and sometimes it
            is slow. After all we are downloading thousands of roads within an area!

            To improve the performance of download, I indexed ~3,000 cities with population larger than
            100,000 people and stored into a [very
            simple](https://github.com/anvaka/index-large-cities/blob/master/proto/place.proto) protobuf
            format. The cities are stored into a cache in this github
            [repository](https://github.com/anvaka/index-large-cities).

            The name resolution is done by [nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) - for any query
            that you type into the search box it returns list of area ids. I check for the area id in my
            list of cached cities first, and fallback to overpass if area is not present in cache.

            Behind simple UI software engineers would also find scripting capabilities. You can develop
            programs on top of the city-roads. A few examples are available in
            [city-script](https://github.com/anvaka/city-script). Scene API is documented here:

  about:    SQL-compatible access to relational, semi-structured, and nested data.

            **First Class Nested Data**: PartiQL’s extensions to SQL are easy to understand, treat nested
            data as first class citizens and compose seamlessly with each other and SQL. This enables
            intuitive filtering, joining and aggregation on the combination of structured, semistructured
            and nested datasets.

            **Data Storage Independence**: PartiQL enables unified query access across multiple data stores
            and data formats by separating the syntax and semantics of a query from the underlying format of
            the data or the data store that is being accessed. It enables users to interact with data with
            or without regular schema.

  title:    Bulk loading into PostgreSQL: Options and comparison
  about:    You have a file, possibly a huge CSV, and you want to import its content into your database.
            There are lots of options to do this but how would you decide which one to use. More often than
            not the question is how much time would the bulk load would take. I found my self doing the same
            few days back when I wanted to design a data ingestion process for PostgreSQL where we needed to
            bulk load around 250GB of data from CSV files every 24 hours.

            Goto solution for bulk loading into PostgreSQL is the native copy command. But one limitation
            with the copy command is that it requires the CSV file to be placed on the server. So I decided
            to do a simple comparison of bulk loading options and techniques.

            In short I wanted to see the performance difference of loading the data into standard vs
            unlogged tables and want to compare the loading time difference between loading into table that
            has an index vs drop-index->load->recreate-index option.

            Moreover, I wanted to see the performance difference of COPY command, client-side copy command,
            loading through file_fdw, and pg_bulkload for each of the above options.

  title:    Node Modules at War: Why CommonJS and ES Modules Can’t Get Along: Interop between them is
            possible, but it’s a hassle
  about:    In Node 14, there are now two kinds of scripts: there are old-style CommonJS (CJS) scripts and
            new-style ESM scripts (aka MJS). CJS scripts use require() and module.exports; ESM scripts use
            import and export.

            I’ll conclude with three guidelines for library authors to follow:
            * Provide a CJS version of your library
            * Provide a thin ESM wrapper for your CJS named exports
            * Add an exports map to your package.json

  tags:     rust font-rendering text typesetting
  title:    RustType
  about:    RustType is a pure Rust alternative to libraries like FreeType.

            The current capabilities of RustType:

            * Reading OpenType formatted fonts and font collections. This includes `*.ttf` as well as
              `*.otf` font files.
            * Retrieving glyph shapes and commonly used properties for a font and its glyphs. Laying out
              glyphs horizontally using horizontal and vertical metrics, and glyph-pair-specific kerning.
            * Rasterising glyphs with sub-pixel positioning using an accurate analytical algorithm (not
              based on sampling).
            * Managing a font cache on the GPU with the gpu_cache module. This keeps recently used glyph
              renderings in a dynamic cache in GPU memory to minimise texture uploads per-frame. It also
              allows you keep the draw call count for text very low, as all glyphs are kept in one GPU
              texture.

            Notable things that RustType does not support yet:

            * Font hinting.
            * Ligatures of any kind.
            * Some less common TrueType sub-formats.
            * Right-to-left and vertical text layout.

            https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/nsvrta/textwrap_0140_released_with_support_for_wrapping/
  about:    "Textwrap is a library for wrapping and indenting text. It is most often used by command-line
            programs to format dynamic output nicely so it looks good in a terminal. However, you can use
            the library to wrap arbitrary things by implementing the Fragment trait — an example would be
            wrapping text for PDF files."

            As such `textwrap` warps text based on the Unicode width of each character; however, by using
            the [`textwrap::core::fragment`](https://docs.rs/textwrap/0.13.2/textwrap/core/trait.Fragment.html)
            trait, it is possible to deal with arbitrary chunks having arbitrarily derived widths, no matter
            their textual (or non-textual) contents:

            ```rust
            pub trait Fragment: Debug {
                pub fn width(&self) -> usize;
                pub fn whitespace_width(&self) -> usize;
                pub fn penalty_width(&self) -> usize; }
            ```

            A (text) fragment denotes the unit which we wrap into lines.

            Fragments represent an abstract word plus the whitespace following the word. In case the word
            falls at the end of the line, the whitespace is dropped and a so-called penalty is inserted
            instead (typically "-" if the word was hyphenated).

            For wrapping purposes, the precise content of the word, the whitespace, and the penalty is
            irrelevant. All we need to know is the displayed width of each part, which this trait provides.

            Neutralinojs apps will work on Linux, Windows and macOS. Single application package can be
            released for all popular operating systems.

            An uncompressed Neutralinojs lightweight cross-platform app is only ~10MB and compressed app
            size is ~2MB. Indeed, it will not consume either physical memory or storage like any other
            chromium based cross-platform application development frameworks.

            No extra dependencies are required to run lightweight cross-platforms apps built with
            Neutralinojs. SDK is fully portable. You will be able to debug applications using your favourite
            web browser.

            Neutralinojs Javascript API exposes access to operating system level functions such as file
            manipulation, executing commands, showing native dialog boxes etc.

  title:    Hypermerge
  tags:     Conflict-Free-Replicated-Data-Type CRDT p2p local-first
  about:    Hypermerge is a Node.js library for building p2p collaborative applications without any server
            infrastructure. It combines Automerge, a CRDT, with hypercore, a distributed append-only log.

            This project provides a way to have apps data sets that are conflict free and offline first
            (thanks to CRDT's) and serverless (thanks to hypercore/DAT).

            There are several example repos in the /examples directory, including a very simple two-repo
            code demo and a simple CLI-based chat application.

            The best demonstration of Hypermerge is PushPin, which shows Hypermerge in "full flight",
            including taking advantage of splitting the fast, simple front-end from the more expensive,
            slower back-end.

  title:    Automerge
  tags:     Conflict-Free-Replicated-Data-Type CRDT p2p local-first
  about:    Automerge is a library of data structures for building collaborative applications in JavaScript.
            It supports automatic syncing and merging:

            * You can have a copy of the application state locally on several devices (which may belong to
              the same user, or to different users). Each user can independently update the application
              state on their local device, even while offline, and save the state to local disk.

            * (Similar to git, which allows you to edit files and commit changes offline.)

            * When a network connection is available, Automerge figures out which changes need to be synced
              from one device to another, and brings them into the same state.

            * (Similar to git, which lets you push your own changes, and pull changes from other developers,
              when you are online.)

            * If the state was changed concurrently on different devices, Automerge automatically merges the
              changes together cleanly, so that everybody ends up in the same state, and no changes are
              lost.

            (Different from git: no merge conflicts to resolve!)

  tags:     bitemporal temporal-DB
  about:    Bitemporal Modeling is a specific case of Temporal database information modeling technique
            designed to handle historical data along two different timelines.[1] This makes it possible to
            rewind the information to "as it actually was" in combination with "as it was recorded" at some
            point in time. In order to be able to do so, information cannot be discarded even if it is
            erroneous. Within, for example, financial reporting it is often desirable to be able to recreate
            an old report both as it actually looked at the time of creation and as it should have looked
            given corrections made to the data after its creation.

            Implementations of Bitemporal Modeling are mostly done using relational databases. As such,
            Bitemporal Modeling is considered different from Dimensional Modeling and complementary to
            database normalization. The SQL:2011 standard provides language constructs for working with
            bitemporal data. However, many of current solutions are still vendor-specific.

            Vale's goal is to show the world that speed and safety can be easy. Vale is:

            * *Fast*: Vale is an AOT compiled language that uses an entirely new approach to memory
              management: generational references, which have zero aliasing costs and no garbage collection
              pauses.

            * *Fearless*: It is the safest native language: zero unsafe, region isolation, extern
              boundaries, and dependency extern whitelisting.

            * *Flexible*: Its new take on regions enables alternate memory management and allocation
              strategies, with the region borrow checker enabling seamless, fast, and easy interop between
              them.

  about:    Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is a set of techniques that dramatically speed up
            search-for-neighbors or near-duplication detection on data. These techniques can be used, for
            example, to filter out duplicates of scraped web pages at an impressive speed, or to perform
            near-constant-time lookups of nearby points from a geospatial data set.

  title:    SQLean: all the missing SQLite functions
  about:    SQLite has very few functions compared to other DBMS. SQLite authors see this as a feature
            rather than a bug, because SQLite has extension mechanism in place.

            There are a lot of SQLite extensions out there, but they are incomplete, inconsistent and
            scattered across the internet.

            sqlean brings them all together, neatly packaged by domain modules and built for Linux, Windows
            and macOS.

            Here is what we've got right now:

            * `crypto`: secure hashes
            * `json1`: JSON functions
            * `math`: math functions
            * `re`: regular expressions
            * `stats`: math statistics

  tags:     tagging tags filesystem linux
  about:    Semantic filesystem for Linux, with relation reasoner, autotagging plugins and a deduplication
            service

            Tagsistant is a semantic file system for Linux, a personal tool to catalog files using tags
            (labels, mnemonic informations) rather than directories.

            Tagsistant replace the concept of directory with that of tag, but since it have to do with
            directories, it pairs the concept of tag with that of directory. So within Tagsistant a tag is a
            directory and a directory is a tag.

            To be more precise, this is not true with all the directories. First level directories are
            special. The one called tags/ hosts all the tags. This means that every directory created inside
            it is infact a tag.

            Another, called store/, hosts contents, like files. All the tags created inside tags/ are
            available inside store/. To tag a file all you have to do is to copy it inside one or more
            directories under store/.

            Another special first level directory is relations/. Inside it you can establish relations
            between tags using mkdir:

            ```
            $ mkdir relations/music/includes/rock
            $ mkdir relations/rock/includes/beatles
            $ mkdir relations/beatles/includes/lennon
            $ mkdir relations/beatles/is_equivalent/the_beatles
            $ mkdir relations/lennon/requires/beatles
            ```

            A reasoner follows the relations you establish to include objects as a result of your queries.
            This is an example:

            ```
            $ cp ~/let_it_be.mp3 store/lennon/@/
            $ ls store/the_beatles/@/
            let_it_be.mp3
            ```

            The file let_it_be.mp3 is tagged as lennon, which is included by beatles, which is equivalent to
            the_beatles, and so is listed.

            Tagsistant also comes with a plugin API to extend its behaviour. Some plugins for .ogg, .mp3,
            .xml, .html and other formats are provided. What they do is add more tags to a file, using
            specific procedures.

            And if a file is copied inside Tagsistant twice, Tagsistant is able to pair the second copy with
            the first one, keeping it just one.

            A second benefit is security. Writing security sensitive code in a low level language like C is
            error prone and could lead to privilege escalation. [...] py2many can be a more general purpose
            solution to the problem where you can verify the source via unit tests before you transpile.

            A third potential use case is to accelerate python code by transpiling it into an extension.

  title:    SANE Command-Line Scan to PDF
  about:    Sane command-line scanning bash shell script on Linux with OCR and deskew support. The script
            automates common scan-to-pdf operations for scanners with an automatic document feeder, such as
            the awesome Fujitsu ScanSnap S1500, with output to PDF files.

            Tested and run regularly on Fedora, but should work on other distributions with the requirements
            below.

            ## Features

            * Join scanned pages into a single output file, or specify a name for each page
            * Deskew (if supported by scanner driver, or software-based via unpaper)
            * Crop (if supported by scanner driver)
            * Creates searchable PDFs (with tesseract)
            * Duplex (if scanner supports it)
            * Specify resolution
            * Truncate n pages explicitly from end of scan e.g. duplex scanning with last page truncated
            * Skip white-only pages automatically (with ImageMagick)
            * Specify page width and height for odd size pages, or common sizes (Letter, Legal, A4)
            * Performance: scanner run in parallel with page post-processing
            * Limit parallel processing for very fast scanners or constrained environments (if sem installed)
            * Post-scan open scan output(s) in viewer

            using it as an advanced C# and then, as learning goes on, employ a range of cool features
            enabling metaprogramming and functional programming. The metaprogramming is based on macros
            bearing some similarity to Lisp.

    remark: shell with its own command line language

            Crush is an attempt to make a command line shell that is also a powerful modern programming
            language. It has the features one would expect from a modern programming language like a type
            system, closures and lexical scoping, but with a syntax geared toward both batch and interactive
            shell usage.

            Many Crush commands operate on streams of tabular data. Command output is not sent over a unix
            pipe but over a Rush channel. It is not understood by the command as a series of bytes, but as a
            table of rows, and Crush provides you with SQL-like commands to sort, filter, aggregate and
            group rows of data.

    remark: compiles to C

            Simple, fast, safe, compiled. For developing maintainable software.

            Simple language for building maintainable programs

            You can learn the entire language by going through the documentation in an hour, and in most
            cases there's only one way to do something.

            This results in simple, readable, and maintainable code.

            Despite being simple, V gives a lot of power to the developer and can be used in pretty much
            every field, including systems programming, webdev, gamedev, GUI, mobile (wip), science,
            embedded, tooling, etc.

            V is very similar to Go. If you know Go, you already know ≈80% of V. Things V improves on Go:
